# LOWESS (Locally Weighted scatterplot Smoothing, also known as locally weighted polynomial regression)
This is my first machine learning practice. The pipeline will fit dose-response curves using the model specified by user, LOWESS by default. Briefly, the fitted model shows the relationship of receptor activity (y-axis) to changes in drug concentration (x-axis). Other models can be added to the codes (not implemented yet) and then user can select the specific model to fit the data.
